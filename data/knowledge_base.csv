"What is Python?","Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its easy readability and vast ecosystem of libraries for web development, data science, and AI."
"Define a variable in Python.","A variable in Python is created when you assign a value to it, like `x = 5`. It does not require explicit declaration of the type."
"What is a list in Python?","A list is a mutable, ordered collection of items in Python, defined using square brackets, e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`."
"What is a dictionary in Python?","A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, defined using curly braces, e.g., `my_dict = {'key': 'value'}`."
"Explain the difference between a list and a tuple.","Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation). Lists use `[]`, tuples use `()`."
"What is a function in Python?","A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the `def` keyword."

"What is the derivative of x^2?","The derivative of x^2 with respect to x is 2x."
"What is the derivative of sin(x)?","The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x)."
"What is a limit in calculus?","A limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value. It is fundamental to defining continuity, derivatives, and integrals."
"What is an integral?","An integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that describes displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data."
"What is the chain rule?","The chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of the composition of two or more functions: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)."
"What is a Git commit?","A commit in Git records changes to the repository. It saves a snapshot of the project's current state with a message describing the changes."
"What is Flask?","Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications."
